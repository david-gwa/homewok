### test background 


the typical(fail) scenario/event is what the team focused on. rosbag is one way to track the fail events,  `dlt` log the corresponding vehicle pose data, which is actually where the team used to improve the ADS algorithms.


currently, the fail scenario is manually done by the vehicle testers, who record the fail event(such as sudden brake, can't lane change). if we can learning these `failure features` from the logging data, which will help to define the standard evaluation metrics, then used in vehicle test and simulation

### data cycle 


the closed-loop data cycle, should be the right way to couple test and development. 

#### data storage 

* dlt log data
* event/failure scenario 

#### big data tool

* [abnormal detection](https://github.com/twitter/AnomalyDetection), which helps to analysis the log data and find anormal features, which is highly possible an failure event

the benefits of this data toool chain, is to automatic connect our test data and development.
