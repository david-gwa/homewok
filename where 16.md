after half year working in ADS simuluation tool development, the passion in project is gone now. and the question: what's the realy problem of ADS, comes out.  gradually lose the vision of ADS. where it points to ? 

### a tool developer 

from the first job, I was working as a tool developer, to build up fatigue CAE analysis tool;  then to build up ADS simulation tool till now.  both job experience has a broad range of programming skills, actually I was in IT deparment at Ford; then as ADS bursting, more and more software skills are required by tradititional automobile makers and suppliers.

tool developer is in general a developer, requires IT coding mindset, but unlike Internet companies, auto makers or suppliers doesn't directly sell codes as products in most situations.  beyond softwares, the IT eco-system or IT infrastrucure is becoming more and more important as AI, big data are becoming the the new trend, but which is further far from the traditional leaders' thoughts. And this is a gap for automobile makers and suppliers to transfer from tranditional manufacture to modern digital driven enterprise

the idea of digitalized has a long time, which was focused on improving management, market decision, public representation efficiently and high-tech feeling, but sinking to product R&D, which is still on-going.

tool is tool, in common is defined and created by professional tool makers, such as ANSYS, Dassult System, Siemens e.t.c.   OEM itself mostly doesn't build tools itself, even like Ford, who hired a great team to develop CAE tools in early days and build them tremendous, still retired most of them or sell them as packages to pure software vendors later.

the pioneers or leaders of a special industry, usually build and apply new methodlogy before a clear market is there. and after the market is matured, it's efficient and money-save to have vendor's maintain and enhencement the tools.  the leaders take the role as incubators,  which is very common in Internt industry, as many Internet startups got the ideas from giants e.g. Google, Facebook e.t.c

ADS at this moment is the emerging tech, there is no mature solution or tool chain for ADS, so the leaders of automobile makers and suppliers are the guys who have to take the lead to set up standards and tools till ADS market goes to mature. and the giants in automobile should catch this great opportunity to take control in long term. 

the problems of Chinese OEMs (sadly there is no strong Chinese suppliers yet),  they are customed to be followers, when US or German auto makers do the research and make the new bussiness stratagey, Chinese OEMs will follow.  as the blog said, Chinese has no friend, neither Chinese goverment.  be the followers or imitators is minimal loss strategy for most Chinese companies as well.  and this is also why west coutry companies are afriad of the competition from Chinese. Chinese take copy others ideas as a strategy to success, rather than a shame.

a tool developer is never the core product of auto makers, on the other way, the skills is general, without limitation in auto industry, with a high possibility jumping to other industies, if the skills are strong enough. e.g. AI. cloud, big data.

it's maybe more interested to take myself as an ABC(AI, big data, cloud computing) guy to find application scenarios in automobile industry product development. while ABC application scenarios are not matured yet of course, usually it is driven by leader teams, when it comes to drive by market, may be too late. 

beyond automotive, industry IoT maybe an even general domain to quickly apply ABCs. there should be three steps:

* familiar with the tech methods

* understand the hurting points of the industry 

* product and management update -> value return 


this is the new vision, rather than as a pure vehicle industry, 



### a product engineer

ADS products has returned to L2+ , which 





### what about management
