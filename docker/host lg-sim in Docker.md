can't believe that, only a few monthes later, I have no idea how to run a docker. that's awesome !



```shell

docker ps  #get running container ID

docker exec -it containerID /bin/bash


docker run -it

docker-compose up build/run



```

* build the new server 

* [build local Docker registry](https://code-maze.com/docker-hub-vs-creating-docker-registry/)

* [local save and export](https://gitee.com/GWM_ADS_SIM/cloud-based-ADS-simulation/issues/IYQ9K)

### issues 
* start docker service on localmachine
